title: The Golden Sun Set - Arriving Dec 25, 2019
---

Over the next year, I will be working on a reorchestrated album of Golden Sun and Golden Sun: The Lost Age music called "The Golden Sun Set". I'm hoping to release the album on December 25, 2019 on all of the major music platforms. 

The album art is below. The album art base image was found at the URL: [https://www.pexels.com/photo/flight-landscape-nature-sky-36717/](https://www.pexels.com/photo/flight-landscape-nature-sky-36717/). It is a royalty-free image that can be used for any legal purpose and can be modified. The font I used for the text in the album art is called “Elementary Gothic Bookhand” and can be used for free for commercial and non-commercial use. It can be found at the URL: [https://www.dafont.com/elementary-gothic-bookhand.font](https://www.dafont.com/elementary-gothic-bookhand.font).

So far, it's looking like the album will be about 41 GS/TLA songs and 5 Golden Sun: Dark Dawn songs, but the final count may change closer to release. The tentative tracklist is below. I'm planning on adding links to work-in-progress tracks on my SoundCloud as I work on the album.
