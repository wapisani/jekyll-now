title: The Golden Sun Set - Arriving Dec 25, 2019
---

Over the next year, I will be working on a reorchestrated album of Golden Sun and Golden Sun: The Lost Age music called "The Golden Sun Set". I'm hoping to release the album on December 25, 2019 on all of the major music platforms. 

Update May 21, 2019:
Eleven (11) in-progress tracks so far. The target date for finishing the album is Thanksgiving 2019. I don't think the original tracklist will be the final list since there are 35 more tracks left to go and six months left. Plus research to conduct, a dissertation to write and defend, moving, starting a new job, etc. There are probably not going to be more than 20 tracks, if that. Perhaps there will be a volume 2 in the future.

The final tracklist will probably be more like the list below.
1. The First Book

So far, it's looking like the album will be about 41 GS/TLA songs and 5 Golden Sun: Dark Dawn songs, but the final count may change closer to release. The tentative tracklist is below. I'm planning on adding links to work-in-progress tracks on my SoundCloud as I work on the album.
