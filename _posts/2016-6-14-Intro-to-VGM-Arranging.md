title:  Reorchestrating Video Game Music
---

In my spare time, I enjoy reorchestrating video game music. Reorchestration is the process of arranging a piece of music for orchestra and then using high-quality sample libraries (virtual orchestras) to render the piece of music. I'm the Lead Reorchestrator of [Metroid Reorchestrated](http://www.mreomusic.com), a website dedicated to transforming the music of the Metroid video game franchise into orchestral masterpieces.

With regards to music making, I specialize in creating high-definition covers of old video game music. I arrange a piece of music for orchestra and then use high-quality sample libraries (virtual orchestras) to render the piece of music. I use Reaper as my DAW (Digital Audio Workstation), and EastWest Quantum Leap Symphonic Orchestra Gold (EWQLSO Gold) and EastWest Quantum Leap Symphonic Choirs as my high-quality sample libraries.
