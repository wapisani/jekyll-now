title:  Reorchestrating Video Game Music
---

In my spare time, I enjoy reorchestrating video game music. Reorchestration is the process of arranging a piece of music for orchestra and then using high-quality sample libraries (virtual orchestras) to render the piece of music. I'm the Lead Reorchestrator of [Metroid Reorchestrated](http://www.mreomusic.com), a website dedicated to transforming the music of the Metroid video game franchise into orchestral masterpieces. Metroid Reorchestrated, or MREO as I will be referring to it from now on, hasn't been updated in a while because I've been quite busy with my Ph.D. coursework and research. Hopefully I'll have some time this summer to reboot an MREO project called ["Metroid Orchestral Fusion"](http://ocremix.org/community/topic/41238-metroid-orchestral-fusion/) which focuses on arranging/remixing the music of "Metroid Fusion" in orchestral and electronic styles. Please see the link above for more details.

With regards to music making, I specialize in creating high-definition covers of old video game music. I arrange a piece of music for orchestra and then use high-quality sample libraries (virtual orchestras) to render the piece of music. I use Reaper as my DAW (Digital Audio Workstation), and EastWest Quantum Leap Symphonic Orchestra Gold (EWQLSO Gold) and EastWest Quantum Leap Symphonic Choirs as my high-quality sample libraries. Below is a picture of 2011 me holding the boxed versions of EWQLSO and EWQLSC.

So far I have one licensed album of arranged video game music called *Aural Nostaliga Vol 1*. It was released in May of 2014 and is available on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/album/aural-nostalgia-vol-1/id872777033?v0=9988&ign-mpt=uo%3D1), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/music/album/Will_Pisani_Aural_Nostalgia_Vol_1?id=Bm3yzwsjuej6y57hkeewege4siu), [Loudr](http://www.loudr.fm/release/aural-nostalgia-vol-1/NZEXT), and [Spotify](https://play.spotify.com/album/6GbX9I4VbLUTvQJAiRSkGy) for $8.00.
