title: Yay! I have Jekyll working!
---

Hi! My name is Will Pisani. I'm a second-year Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering - Engineering Mechanics at [Michigan Technological University](http://www.mtu.edu). My area of research is in using high-performance computing clusters to conduct molecular dynamics modeling of polymer composites. Understanding how polymer composites (widely used in the aerospace and automotive industries) behave at the molecular level is critical for building better polymer composites. Thanks to this [guide by Barry Clark](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/), I now have a blog that can be version controlled with Git. I plan to write about technical topics like Linux, molecular dynamics modeling, programming with Python and C/C++, and maybe a few other things. I'll also probably write about gaming and arranging video game music.
