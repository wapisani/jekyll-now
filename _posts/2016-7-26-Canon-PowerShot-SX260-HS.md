title:  My Best Zoo Pictures So Far
---

When I studied abroad in Chengdu, China three years ago, my Dad loaned me his Canon point-and-shoot camera. I fairly quickly realized that I take pretty good pictures ([China pictures here](https://www.pisanifamily.info/will/screenshots/lychee/index.html#15583123715421)), so for Christmas that year I received a [Canon PowerShot SX260 HS](https://www.amazon.com/Canon-PowerShot-Digital-Stabilized-Wide-Angle/dp/B0075SUK14). It's a great camera for my needs which include taking pictures at tourist locations (zoos, museums, etc.), taking still pictures of family, friends, and pets, and taking the occasional video. It has served me quite well.

When I went to the [Cleveland](http://www.clevelandmetroparks.com/Zoo/Zoo.aspx) and [Milwaukee](http://www.milwaukeezoo.org/) zoos this summer, I took a couple hundred pictures. The purpose of this post is to share my best pictures. It's pretty amazing what this little camera can do! The four pictures shown below are smaller versions of the originals. To view the pictures full-size (they're 4000 by 3000), right-click the name of the animal and left-click "Open link in new tab". Then left-click on the image in the new tab and it should now be full-size.

Feel free to download these pictures for your personal use. If you want to share these images with others, please make sure to include a link back to this blog (http://wapisani.github.io) and credit me (Will Pisani).

As you can see, the Cleveland visit was much more fruitful than the Milwaukee visit. I attribute that to the fact that the enclosures at the Cleveland zoo were more open or used wire unlike the Milwaukee zoo which had a lot more glass. You can tell that my camera was able to focus past the wire for the eagle and ocelot (it's hard to tell, but there was wire between the ocelot and me).
