My name is Will Pisani. Iâ€™m a second-year Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering - Engineering Mechanics at Michigan Technological University. My area of research is in using high-performance computing clusters to conduct molecular dynamics modeling of polymer composites. Understanding how polymer composites (widely used in the aerospace and automotive industries) behave at the molecular level is critical for building better polymer composites.
