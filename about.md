Hi! My name is Will Pisani. I'm a computational materials scientist with a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering - Engineering Mechanics from Michigan Technological University. This blog mainly focuses on my hobbies/interests (below) with some life events and career-related posts now and again.



### What does a computational materials scientist do?

Broadly, I use supercomputers to design next-generation materials that will make cars and planes more fuel efficient and enable the construction of space vehicles to take humanity to Mars and beyond. Specifically, I use molecular dynamics modeling to predict mechanical, thermal, and interfacial properties of polymers and their composites at the atomistic scale. These predictions inform the design process of advanced polymer composites, allowing experimentalists to manufacture and test the right combinations of materials with little to no wasted time, effort, and material.

### What do I do for fun?

In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games, reading novels, watching TV/movies with the love of my life, playing with our three cats and one dog, programming in Python, and arranging video game music. Lately I've been playing a lot of Pokemon Y on the Nintendo 3DS; I've been working on doing mono-type runs. So far I have completed a mono-fire run and now I'm working on a mono-bug run.
